<!-- INSTALLATION -->
## Installation 
**Prerequisites**: Make sure that the following dependencies are installed on your machine:
- Git
- Java JDK 21
- JavaFX21

**Install Game**: Navigate to your local game directory and add necessary packages (set up JDK and JavaFX)

<!-- MOTIVATION -->
## Motivation 
We are working with this game as our project lab of Object Oriented Programming is a 4-credit course. During our investigation into how to create 2D games with Java, we remembered the Chicken Invaders game which was popular in our childhood.

<!-- CHALLENGES -->
# Challenges
- *Working with Existing Code*: It was difficult to understand and develop for the existing codebase, sometimes it was hard to develop new features as all classes and packages are fixed
- *Balancing Difficulty*: Finding the right balance to make the game challenging but not too hard for gamers was a tough task.
- *Using JavaFX Framework*: As we were not familiar with the JavaFX framework, it was challenging to use it effectively.

<!-- ACKNOWLEDGMENTS -->
# Acknowledgments
- We would like to extend our heartfelt gratitude to everyone who contributed to the success of our OOP game project. This journey has been incredibly rewarding, and it wouldn’t have been possible without the contribution of each member.
- We’re grateful for the feedback and suggestions from our friends. Their insights have significantly improved the game experience. Thank you to our beta testers who volunteered their time to help us refine our game.
> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project utilizes several open-source tools, OpenAI, and libraries, and we extend our gratitude to the developers and maintainers of these resources. Your work has been vital in bringing our game to life.
